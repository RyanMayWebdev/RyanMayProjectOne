# RyanMayProjectOne

This is a 3 page website that was created based on a provided design. 
Only the desktop view was provided and the mobile view was left for me to decide what would look and function best. 

I used only HTML and SASS to develop this website as requested. 
Each page has it's own partial, combined with a general styling partial and media query partial.
This site is also fully responsive, featuring a animated dropdown mobile emnu done through css. 

There were a few challenges in this project, such as the multiple offset images, which were overcome by either position: absolute or
using a combo of flexbox, align-self and margin, depending on the situation.

Additionally, accessability was kept in mind the whole way through. The HTML is laid out semantically, all inputs have labels, all images have descriptive alt text
and font size was set to 125% as a base or 20px.

Below are the provided designs.
